Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.

- Higher order function basically use for provide abstraction - to simplify code/readblity

When working with arrays, you can use the map(), reduce(), filter(), and sort() functions to manipulate and transform data in an array.
When working with objects, you can use the Object.entries() function to create a new array from an object.


adg:

Higher order function helps to increase the code reusability, improve the readability and make the code more efficient.


REALD EG.

for request POST/PATCH/DELETE we can use higher order

POST = (body) => {

}
delete = (id) => {

}
function request(data , methodCallback){
    //set commong heder property
    // set auth method
}

request(data , POST);
request(Data, delete)
