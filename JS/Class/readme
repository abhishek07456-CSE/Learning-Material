classes basically template for read world enity where we can define intial state and methods to change state.

- people consfue between function have same peoperty as class
First, a function created by class is labelled by a special internal property [[IsClassConstructor]]: true. 

- we can call function without new keywork but not in class
- Classes always use strict. All code inside the class construct is automatically in strict mode.
- Class methods are non-enumerable. A class definition sets enumerable flag to false for all methods in the "prototype".
     That’s good, because if we for..in over an object, we usually don’t want its class methods.



/*
Previously, our classes only had methods.

“Class fields” is a syntax that allows to add any properties.

For instance, let’s add name property to class User:

class User {
  name = "John"; same as constructor this.name

  sayHi() {
    alert(`Hello, ${this.name}!`);
  }
}

new User().sayHi(); // Hello, John!
So, we just write " = " in the declaration, and that’s it.

The important difference of class fields is that they are set on individual objects, not User.prototype:
