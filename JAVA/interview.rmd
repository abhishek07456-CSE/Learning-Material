2) PROFILER
---------------
Java profilers are the finest tools for understanding the behavior and troubleshooting the performance issues of the Java application
- HEAP ALLOCATION
- GARBAGE COLLECTION
- MEMORY ALLOCATION
- WE CAN IMPROVE INTERNAL PERFORMANCE.LIKE MEMORY LEAKAGE OR OTHER ASPECTS

profilers help us to know the status of the JVM execution at the byte code level.

3) finalize
--------------------
always calls just before the deletion/destroying the object which is eligible for Garbage Collection, so as to perform clean-up activity. Clean-up activity means closing the resources associated with that object like Database Connection, Network Connection or we can say resource de-allocation.

            //override finalize method
            protected void finalize() throws Throwable
                {
                    try {

                        System.out.println("inside demo's finalize()");
                    }
                    catch (Throwable e) {

                        throw e;
                    }
                    finally {

                        System.out.println("Calling finalize method"
                                        + " of the Object class");

                        // Calling finalize() of Object class
                        super.finalize();
                    }
                }

4) garbage collector algo (Mark & Sweep, Series & parallel GC, Full and partial GC)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://howtodoinjava.com/java/garbage-collection/revisiting-memory-management-and-garbage-collection-mechanisms-in-java/
Garbage collection is the mechanism used in Java to deallocate unused memory

Mark & Sweep, Series
        It is initial and very basic algorithm which runs in two stages:

        Marking live objects – find out all objects that are still alive.
        Removing unreachable objects – get rid of everything else – the supposedly dead and unused objects.

)Normal deletion - hole create in memory and memory is fragment.
)compact deletion -  move referenced and unreferenced memory together , so that unreferenced memory used together . it is not cause outofmemory exception

)How to improve memory utilization in Java
    Do not allocate excessive memory. Allocate memory only just as much needed. This is specially applicable to Java arrays.
    Don’t hold on to references. Once the object is used and no longer needed, assign null reference to it.
    Find and resolve memory leaks
    Do system profiling on each release to verify memory bumps
    Do not rely on System.gc() to run garbage collection


5) Blue green deployments
-  reduces downtime
-  functionality break

two parallel production env running.let say blue env handle traffic and green is idle.
Whenever new functionality added deployments done in green env and some specific user redirect to green env so that thy can TEST
                     USER request
   load balancer   ------- ----------production (BLUE)
                  |  TEST REQUEST
                   ----------------- production COPY (GREEN)

6) java 8
 1) lambda expression - easy to development and easy to read code
        interface MathOperation {
          int operation(int a, int b);
        }
        MathOperation addition = (int a, int b) -> a + b;

        private int operate(int a, int b, MathOperation mathOperation) {
            return mathOperation.operation(a, b);
        }
 2) Method reference - Method references help to point to methods by their names. A method reference is described using "::" symbol
    System.out::println;

 3) Functional Interface - A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. They can have only one functionality to exhibit. For example, a Comparable interface with a single method ‘compareTo’ is used for comparison purpose

        interface Square
        {
            int calculate(int x);
        }
        Square s = (int x)->x*x;
        int ans = s.calculate(a);


        eval(list, n-> n%2 == 0 );
        public static void eval(List<Integer> list, Predicate<Integer> predicate)
            for(Integer n: list) {
                if(predicate.test(n)) {
                    System.out.println(n + " ");
                }
            }
        }

4) Interface - default class
       interface Vehicle {
            //can override
            default void print() {
                System.out.println("I am a vehicle!");
            }
            //Not override just hide if found in child class also
            static void blowHorn() {
                System.out.println("Blowing horn!!!");
            }
       }

5) Stream - process data like we process data in sql and mysql
   steam vs parallelStream - stream process data sequentially in single cpu core , while parallelStream process data in different core result faster then stream.

   List<String> strings = Arrays.asList("abc", "", "bc", "efg", "abcd","", "jkl");
   List<String> filtered = strings.stream().filter(string -> !string.isEmpty()).collect(Collectors.toList());// return list
   int count = strings.stream().filter(string -> string.isEmpty()).count(); // return count
   String mergedString = strings.stream().filter(string -> !string.isEmpty()).collect(Collectors.joining(", ")); // return string


   List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(3, 2, 2, 3, 7, 3, 5);
   List<Integer> squaresList = numbers.stream().map( i -> i*i).distinct().collect(Collectors.toList());

6) optional class - To avoid abnormal termination, we use the Optional class. In the following example, we are using Optional. So, our program can execute without crashing.

        String[] words = new String[10];
        Optional<String> checkNull =
                      Optional.ofNullable(words[5]);
        if (checkNull.isPresent()) {
            String word = words[5].toLowerCase();
            System.out.print(word);
        } else
            System.out.println("word is null");
